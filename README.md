# finbertuconn2024
Development of a fine-tuned FinBERT model for financial sentiment analysis.
Tokenizer must be the one used in the benchmark_model ipynb file, and the custom class there must also be used. 
Make sure to use transformers==4.37.2 --there is some conflict with later version. You can try to use later versions and debug it yourself.
